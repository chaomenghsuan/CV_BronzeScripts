# CV_BronzeScripts
Class project for Computer Vision. 
(still improving)

The interpretation of Chinese bronze inscriptions has been a crucial subject for scholars for years. With the development of computer vision technologies, it is meaningful to try combining the issue with new methodologies. In this project, I built several Support Vector Machines with different feature sizes to classify three similar-looking bronze inscriptions. Multiple denoising and filtering methods are involved to extract effective features to describe the different shapes of different character types. With results that are 20% above the baseline, some of the methodologies are proved to be effective. Yet, future work are expected to explore further in this topic.
